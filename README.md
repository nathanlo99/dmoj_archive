# DMOJ Archive
An archive of my DMOJ submissions

**How to run the scripts**:
- Move the scripts to a fresh directory
- chmod the scripts
- run dmoj.py before running anything else
- The `working` directory should contain half-done solutions that have not yet gotten AC on DMOJ.
- The `done` directory contains archives of the fastest submissions for any given problem.

**Caveats**:
- A `.dmoj_creds` file will created the first time you run `dmoj.py`, and will contain your username and password in a decodable format. Don't use this script on a public computer

**TODO**:
- Merge submit, problem_info scripts into one file, and pass command-line arguments
- "Un-caps-ify" the submit script
